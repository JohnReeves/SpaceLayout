#Space Worksheet

##Task 1 - Create your Sun

* open [JSFiddle](http://www.jsfiddle.net) in a new tab (preferably using Google Chrome)
* create a blank svg board in the HTML window (top left)

```xml
<svg height="600" width="600">

</svg>
```

* put a square inside
  * 4 coordinates (0,0) (0,600) (600,600) (600,0)
  * fill it with a black colour

```xml
<polygon points="0,0 0,600 600,600 600,0" fill="black"/>
```

* put a circle for the sun in the middle
  * cx = center x value (middle)
  * cy = center y value (middle)
  * r = radius

```xml
<circle cx="300" cy="300" r="50" fill="yellow" />
```

##Task 2 - run and save your work

* click run at the top left - did you get what you expected?
  * press this every time you want to see what your code does 
  * this should then appear in the bottom right box "Result"

* click save at the top left - did you write down the unique URL?
  * JSFiddle creates a unique URL so you don't lose anything
  * next time you can begin where you left off :-)

##Task 3 - put the earth and it's orbit circle

* Let's start by putting an Earth into our solar system
  * Note - the cy value (think of the x and y grid) to move it up and down - cx moves it left and right

```xml
<circle cx="300" cy="100" r="10" fill="green" />
```
  
* Earth will travel in an orbit around the sun (another circle!)
  * Note - fill-opacity = how see-through an item is (0.0) is see-through

```xml
<circle cx="300" cy="300" r="220" stroke-width="1" stroke="white" fill-opacity="0.0"/>
```

***

##Task 4 - put all the other planets in

* look up what other planets we have in our solar system
* In the same way we added the Earth - add in the others
* Hint: start off with Mercury as that is closest to the sun.
* pay attention to the radius (r value) of some planets (jupiter is a bigger than Earth)

Remember to save your JSFiddle and write down the url somewhere - we will be animating our solar system next week!
